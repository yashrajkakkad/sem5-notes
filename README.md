> Markdown lecture notes for Semester 5, BTech in Information and Communication Technology, Ahmedabad University

Notes help a lot, especially during examination time. Many of us spend a lot of time in preparing proper notes. This is an initiative to streamline everyone's effort for collective benefit. 

If we all contribute a little each, we will have a fantastic compilation of notes that we can all use. If you find that this helps you, please consider giving back by enhancing/updating the notes.

## Usage

To properly access the notes, you need to clone the repository and open the directory in [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable). Subject names can be found in "tags" and you can filter/add notes with appropriate tags.

Images inside notes will not be visible over GitHub but can accessed when seen through Notable.
